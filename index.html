	<p>Hello. I am Gayle, a Technical Communications major at Eastern Washington University. Before returning to college I was an avid reader, but now I only have time to read textbooks. Coffee is a necessity of life.

	After graduation I hope to be working from a sandy beach, listening to waves crashing and palm fronds rustling in the tropical breeze.</p>
